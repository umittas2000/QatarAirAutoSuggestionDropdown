# Qatar Air Auto-Suggestion Dropdown Experiment with Selenium
Locate and iterate auto-suggestion dropdown list items under ShadowDom using selenium web driver and Java.

In this experiment project, I tried to locate auto-suggestion dropdown list under ShadowDom, 
Type keyword and capture auto-suggestion items and compare with expected sample values.


**Packages Structure:**

**Classes:** This package will hold object classes such as Airport and it's properties

**CommonMethods:** This package will hold common methods to use across project

**PageObjects:** This package will be in use to minimize complexity of the webElements

There is no any testing framework yet, I will use testNG for further projects to create test cases. 

I will be happy to collaborate in my experiment projects...

Keep in touch!
